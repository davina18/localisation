class MapFeature:
    """
    This class provides the functionality required to use Map Features for Robot     Localization. It has methods for reading
    the feature pose using the robot the sensors (:meth:`GetFeatures`), as well as for computing its:

        * observation model  (:meth:`hf`),
        * inverse observation model (:meth:`g`)
        * and all the required Jacobians (:meth:`Jhfx`, :meth:`Jhfv`, :meth:`Jgx` and :meth:`Jgv`).

    When mapped, a feature may involve 2 different representations:

    * **The observation representation:** which is the representation used by the sensors to observe the feature.
    * **The storage representation:** which is the representation used to store the feature in the map within the state vector.

    For instance, a feature may be observed in polar coordinates but stored in Cartesian coordinates. In this case, the
    observation representation is the Polar coordinates and the storage representation is the Cartesian coordinates. The
    class provides methods to convert from one representation to the other (:meth:`s2o` and :meth:`o2s`) and their corresponding
    Jacobians (:meth:`J_s2o` and :meth:`J_o2s`). By default, the observation representation is the same as the storage representation,
    but this behaviour may be overriden in child classes.
